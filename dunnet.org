Dead end
You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
from each other.
There is a shovel here.
>TECLEO: take shovel
Taken.  
>TECLEO: east
E/W Dirt road
You are on the continuation of a dirt road.  There are more trees on
both sides of you.  The road continues to the east and west.
There is a large boulder here.
>TECLEO: east

You are at a fork of two passages, one to the northeast, and one to the
southeast.  The ground here seems very soft. You can also go back west.
>TECLEO: dig
I think you found something.
>TECLEO: look
Fork
You are at a fork of two passages, one to the northeast, and one to the

>TECLEO: southeast
SE/NW road
You are on a southeast/northwest road.
There is some food here.
>TECLEO: take food
Taken.  
>TECLEO: southeast
Bear hangout
You are standing at the end of a road.  A passage leads back to the
northwest.
There is a ferocious bear here!
>TECLEO: drop food
Done.
The bear takes the food and runs away with it. He left something behind.

You are at the end of the road.  There is a building in front of you
to the northeast, and the road leads back to the southwest.
>TECLEO: in
Old Building hallway
You are in the hallway of an old building.  There are rooms to the east
and west, and doors leading out to the north and south.
>TECLEO: east
Mailroom
You are in a mailroom.  There are many bins where the mail is usually
kept.  The exit is to the west.
>TECLEO: look bin
All of the bins are empty.  Looking closely you can see that there
are names written at the bottom of each bin, but most of them are
faded away so that you cannot read them.  You can only make out three
names:
                   Jeffrey Collier
                   Robert Toukmond
                   Thomas Stock

>TECLEO: west

Computer room
You are in a computer room.  It seems like most of the equipment has
been removed.  There is a VAX 11/780 in front of you, however, with
one of the cabinets wide open.  A sign on the front of the machine
says: This VAX is named âpokeyâ.  To type on the console, use the
âtypeâ command.  The exit is to the east.
The panel lights are steady and motionless.
>TECLEO: insert cpu into vax
As you put the CPU board in the computer, it immediately springs to life.
The lights start flashing, and the fans seem to startup.

Our tcp/ip link to gamma is a little flaky, but seems to work.
The current version of ftp can only send files from your home

* Hints




** Getting Started

***  How do I get into the building?

Go northeast from the Building front.  (NE)

If that doesn't work, it's because you don't have the key.

The key is around somewhere.

Have you seen the bear?

To get to the bear, go (from the Building front) SW, SW, SE, and SE.

***  What do I do about the bear?

Look at him.  Ferocious, isn't he?

He won't attack you if you don't bother him.

Maybe he's just hungry.

Throw him the food.  (THROW FOOD)

***  How do I use the VAX?

Use the TYPE command.  (Didn't you read the sign on the computer?)

Oh, it doesn't work.  Maybe the computer is broken.

There's a part missing from the cabinet.

The missing part is not in the building.

It is outside.

Why do you think you have a shovel?

Find a good place to dig.

Try the fork in the road, where it's soft.  (DIG)

Then PUT CARD IN VAX.

***  How do I login on the VAX?

If the panel lights are steady and motionless, see the previous question.

You need a valid account name and password.

Have you been in the mailroom?

Look at the bins in the mailroom.  (LOOK BINS)

Maybe one of those people has an account.

The account name might be the person's last name.

The password might be the person's first name.

login: toukmond
password: robert

** pokey the VAX

***  How do I login?

See the questions about the VAX under Getting Started.

***  Now that I've logged in, what do I do?

You are using a restricted Bourne shell.  If you've never used Unix,
and don't have any idea what that means, you probably aren't going to
enjoy Dunnet very much.

Use `ls' to list your files.

The files with non-zero size are the commands you can use.

The files that end in .o are object files.

In fact, they're the objects in the game.

Type `uncompress paper.o.Z', `exit', and READ PAPER.

Try browsing through the filesystem.

Try `cd /'.

Try `cd /rooms'.

Try `cd /rooms/fork' and `cat description'.

Try looking in the other subdirectories of /rooms.

Yes, you are inside the computer which is running the Dunnet universe.

Try `cd /rooms/hidden-area', `ls', and `cat description'.

Yes, you can get to the hidden area by going SW from the Bear hangout,
and there is a bracelet there.  Why don't you go get it?

***  Help!  I'm stuck at the '$' prompt.

Lift your hands off the keyboard, stand up, and walk away from the
computer.

Oh, you meant "How do I get from the `$' prompt back to the `>'
prompt?"  Type `exit'.

***  After I've explored pokey, what do I do?

This is a good place to save your game.  If you're at the `$' prompt,
type `exit'.  At the `>' prompt, type SAVE FILENAME (where FILENAME is
the name you want to give the save file).

Did you read the message when you first logged in?

Maybe you could connect to gamma.

Try `rlogin gamma'.

You need a password.  What could it be?

Did you try `robert'?

Did you read the slip of paper?

The password is `worms'.

** The Receiving Room and beyond

***  How do I get to the Receiving room?

If you haven't gotten to the computer room yet, see the questions
under `Getting Started'.

See the questions under `pokey the VAX'.

***  Why do I keep tripping over grues?

Because it's dark and you can't see where you're going.

You need a lamp.

You had one when you started the game.

You need a way to move it from pokey to gamma.

Have you tried FTP?

On pokey, type `ftp gamma'.

You need a username.  What could it be?

`toukmond' won't work.

Neither will any of the other names or words you've seen.

What's the most common FTP username?

Try `anonymous'.

The password should be your mail address (toukmond@pokey).

***  What is this worthless pile of protoplasm?

Did you send something using FTP?

What kind of file ends in .o?

How do you transfer object files using FTP?

Don't object files contain binary data?

You didn't type `binary' before sending a file.

***  Why doesn't the maze go anywhere?

Did you try pressing the button? (PUSH BUTTON)

The passageway closes as soon as you release the button.

Maybe you could find some way to keep the button held down.

You could try putting something on it.

There's a ten pound weight in the weight room.

Just DROP WEIGHT in the Maze button room.

The new passage is to the northwest. (NW)

***  How do I find my way around the maze?

Make a map.

Read the descriptions carefully.

Each room in the maze has a different description.

The last hint contains a complete map of the maze.

                            N  S  E  W  NE  NW  SE  SW  UP  DOWN  You Move
0 Weight room               .  .  .  *  .   .   .   .   .   1     Down

3 thirsty little            .  2  2  3  3   3   4   3   .   2     SE
4 twenty little             .  .  .  2  .   .   .   .   .   5     Down
5 daze of twisty little     .  .  .  .  .   6   4   .   .   .     NW
6 twisty little cabbages    2  2  2  2  0   7   2   2   2   2     NE or NW
7 Reception area            .  *  .  .  .   .   3   .   .   .

***  Why does the building explode?

It's because of something you did.

Or more precisely, something you didn't do.

Have you been in the sauna?

You didn't turn the sauna off before leaving.

***  What should I do at the lake?

This is another good place to save your game.

You need to get across it.

You don't know how to swim.

You need the life preserver from the weight room.

You don't need to put it on, just carry it.

Then go S from Lakefront North.

** The cave and surrounding area

*** What should I do at the chute?

Read the sign.

You should have two objects to put in the chute.

The bracelet and the diamond should go in the chute.

If you haven't found the diamond yet, it's not too late to go back and
get it.

If you can't find it, read "Where are all the treasures located?"
under General Questions.

***  How do I get past the rockslide?

Have you tried digging?

Maybe it would help if you had a better tool than a shovel.

What about a pickaxe?

Or perhaps some dynamite?

Actually, there's no way to get past the rockslide.

***  How do I get past the door with the combination lock?

Go WEST from the North end of cave passage and enter the combination.

Oh, you mean "What's the combination?"

Don't continue until you've found the PC.

The combination is stored on the floppy disk you found in the maze.

See the question about the PC.

***  What should I do in the bathroom?

Aren't you toilet trained?

Actually, if you use the urinal for its usual purpose, you'll destroy
all the treasures you have deposited.

However, you can put a treasure in the urinal, and then FLUSH it.
This will deposit the treasure in the proper place.

You should flush the gold and platinum bars down the urinal before
leaving the cave.

If you didn't put the bracelet and the diamond in the chute, you must
flush them now.

***  What should I do in the bedroom?

What do you usually do in a bedroom?

Why don't you take a nap?

SLEEP

Interesting dream, isn't it?

Why don't you see if you can find the room described in the dream?

***  What is this box with a slit?

Have you examined it? (EXAMINE BOX)

Why don't you follow the directions?

PUT KEY IN BOX

You'll find the upgraded key later in the game.

It will be in the computer room when you return from gamma.

*** What should I do with the PC?

The sign says to type RESET.

The computer won't boot.  Have you examined it?

PUT DISK IN DRIVE
(You found the floppy disk in the "thirsty little" room in the maze.)

Now you can boot the computer with RESET.
Just hit Enter when it asks for the time.

Why don't you try a DIR?

How about TYPE FOO.TXT

Remember the combination shown.  It will change every time you play.

Now type EXIT to return to the game.

***  What should I do with the IBM 3090/600s?

This is a good place to save your game.

Have you examined it?

There's nowhere for you to type.

This is "gamma", the computer you used `rlogin' to access.

What would happen if you disconnected the cable?

You can't unplug it.

There's more than one way to disconnect a cable.

This problem calls for drastic measures.

Have you found an axe?

CUT CABLE

** The Meadow and the town

***  How do I get past the gate?

Have you tried NW?

Have you examined the gate?

Why is it so large?

It's not a pedestrian gate.

The gate opens automatically if you are driving the bus.

If you went in on the bus and then left on foot, you're stuck.
I hope you have a saved game.

***  How do I drive the bus?

Just type IN to get in the bus.

You must have your bus-driver's license, of course.
(You should have picked it up in the Meadow.)

Then just move normally (N, S, etc.).  Type OUT to get off the bus.

***  Where can I deposit my treasures?
    
Have you seen any likely spots?

What about the mail drop at the Post Office?

Once you get to the subway, there's a garbage disposal chute at the
North End of N/S Tunnel.

Either one will work fine.

***  The Museum of Natural History

****   What does the switch marked "BL" do?

Why not try it?  (SWITCH SWITCH)

It controls something elsewhere in the museum.

Explore the museum before and after flipping the switch.

It controls the black light in the Marine life area.

***  I've explored the town and the museum.  Now what do I do?

Have you been in the Marine Life Area in the museum?

Have you flipped the switch in the Maintenance Room?  (SWITCH SWITCH)

Have you been in the Marine Life Area after turning the switch on?

Have you examined various objects under the black light?

Have you examined the dinosaur bone from the lobby in the black light?

The writing on the bone suggests that an explosion at Fourth St. and
Vermont might be useful.

Do you know where you can get a bomb?

Maybe you can make one.

Do you know what you get when you mix glycerine and nitric acid?

Nitroglycerine is a powerful explosive.

It's also very unstable.  It tends to explode when jarred.

Get the glycerine (from the Classroom), the nitric acid (from the
Maintenance Room), and the jar (from the Marine Life Area).  Then go
to Fourth St. and Vermont.

PUT ACID IN JAR

PUT GLYCERINE IN JAR

DROP JAR

BOARD TRAIN

***  Is the subway important?

Don't continue until you're in the subway.
See the previous question if you can't find it.

Have you explored it?

There's an amethyst at the bottom of the stairs.

There's also another computer room down there.

See the first question under The End Game.

** The End Game

***  How do I get to the endgame?

Don't continue unless you have scored all 90 points.

Don't continue unless you have been in the subway.

Did you see the computer room in the subway?

Do you know the name of that computer?

Type `rlogin endgame' on pokey.

***  The endgame questions (spoilers)

Fourth (Vermont is an avenue.)

****   What type of bear was hiding your key?

grizzly

****   Which street in town is named after a U.S. state?

** General Questions

***  What is the object of the game?

Have you tried HELP?

Dunnet is your standard "collect the treasures and bring them to the
treasure room" game.

***  How do I find out what my score is?

Why are you so concerned about grades, anyway?

Type SCORE.  (This only works at the `>' prompt, not when you're using
one of the computers.)

***  Where are all the treasures located?

****   Where is the bracelet?

See the questions under "pokey the VAX".

The bracelet is in a hidden area SW of the Bear hangout.

****   Where is the diamond?

Don't read this until you've gotten to Lakefront North.

The diamond is hidden in one of the objects you should have collected
by now.

It's in the statue of RMS.

There is a way to get the diamond out of the statue.

What is the statue made of?

What happens to wax when it gets hot?

Take the statue into the sauna and turn up the heat until it melts.
TURN DIAL CLOCKWISE (three times)

****   Where is the gold bar?

The gold bar is in the Misty Room at the cave entrance.
